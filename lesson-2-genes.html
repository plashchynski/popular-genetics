      <h2>Genes</h2>
      <p>
        DNA contains a lot of information, most of which seems meaningless or random. The sections of DNA that contain essential information are called genes. Genes are passed on from parent to child and are an important part of what decides how children look and act (their biological properties). Genes affect the way our bodies work, including how we look. Our eye, hair and skin color are decided by genes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Humans have about 20,000 genes, but the exact number is a matter of controversy. Half of a person's genes come from the mother. The other half come from the father.

      <h2>Proteins</h2>
      <p>
        If DNA is just a storage of information, proteins do all the essential work. Proteins are extremely diverse in structure and function. Proteins take part in virtually every process in cells. Some proteins are enzymes that catalyze (help to happen) biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Many proteins have structural or mechanical functions, such as in muscle and in cells. Other proteins are important in cell signalling, immune responses, and cell division. Most of our traits are determined by the quantity and quality of proteins that are synthesized in our cells.

      <p>
        Most of the genes are instructions how to build a particular protein. Genes contain the information about protein structure that determines its properties and functions Different proteins are encoded in different genes. Also, DNA contains information about conditions under which the protein is synthesized by the cell. Cells need different proteins in different situations.
