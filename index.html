  <main>
    <p>
      Genetics is the branch of biology which study how parents pass their characteristics to their children. In this brief course, we'll go over the most important aspects of genetics. You will learn what DNA and genes are. How hereditary information is stored in living cells and how mutations arise.
    </p>

    <p>
      A living cell is as complex as a passenger plane or even a space station. Despite many years of efforts, scientists still have not been able to fully understand all the processes that take place in the cell. I deliberately omit many difficult topics in order to give a clear overall picture. It doesn't pretend to be complete.
    </p>

    <p>
      The courses do not require any prior knowledge, all that is required of you is curiosity. At the end of each lesson, I provide a list of free materials where you can study the topic in more detail.
