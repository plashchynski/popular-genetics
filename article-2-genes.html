        <h2>Genes</h2>
        <p>
          DNA contains a lot of information, most of which seems meaningless or random. The sections of DNA that contain essential information are called genes. Genes are passed on from parent to child and are an important part of what decides how children look and act (their biological properties). Genes affect the way our bodies work, including how we look. Our eye, hair and skin color are decided by genes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Humans have about 20,000 genes, but the exact number is a matter of controversy. Half of a person's genes come from the mother. The other half come from the father.

        <h2>RNA</h2>

        <p>
          <dfn>Ribonucleic acid (RNA)</dfn> is a complex molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes.
        </p>

        <p>
          RNA is physically different from DNA: DNA contains two intercoiled strands, but RNA only contains one single strand. RNA also contains different bases from DNA. These bases are the following:

          <ul>
            <li><dfn>A</dfn> Adenine</li>
            <li><dfn>G</dfn> Guanine</li>
            <li><dfn>C</dfn> Cytosine</li>
            <li><dfn>U</dfn> Uracil</li>
          </ul>

          Adenine forms bonds with uracil, and guanine forms bonds with cytosine. In this way, we say that adenine is complementary to uracil and that guanine is complementary to cytosine. The first three bases are also found in DNA, but uracil replaces thymine as a complement to adenine.

        <p>
          RNA is the carrier of genetic information in certain viruses, especially the retroviruses like the HIV virus. This is the only exception to the general rule that DNA is the hereditary substance.

        <h2>Proteins</h2>
        <p>
          If DNA is just a storage of information, proteins do all the essential work. Proteins are extremely diverse in structure and function. Proteins take part in virtually every process in cells. Some proteins are enzymes that catalyze (help to happen) biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Many proteins have structural or mechanical functions, such as in muscle and in cells. Other proteins are important in cell signalling, immune responses, and cell division. Most of our traits are determined by the quantity and quality of proteins that are synthesized in our cells.

        <p>
          Most of the genes are instructions how to build a particular protein. Genes contain the information about protein structure that determines its properties and functions Different proteins are encoded in different genes. Also, DNA contains information about conditions under which the protein is synthesized by the cell. Cells need different proteins in different situations.

        <h2>The central dogma</h2>
        <p>
          <dfn>The central dogma</dfn> of molecular biology is an explanation of the flow of genetic information within a biological system. It is often stated as “DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein”. The dogma is a framework for understanding the transfer of biological information between information-carrying biopolymers in living organisms. There are 3 major classes of such biopolymers: DNA and RNA (both nucleic acids), and protein.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          The general transfers describe the normal flow of biological information: DNA can be copied to DNA (DNA replication), DNA information can be copied into mRNA (transcription), and proteins can be synthesized using the information in mRNA as a template (translation).
