        <h2>Genes</h2>
        <p>
          <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> contains a lot of information, most of which seems meaningless or random. The sections of <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> that contain essential information are called genes. Genes are passed on from parent to child and are an important part of what decides how children look and act (their biological properties). Genes affect the way our bodies work, including how we look. Our eyes, hair, and skin color are decided by genes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Humans have about 20,000 genes, but the exact number is a matter of controversy. Half of a person's genes come from the mother. The other half comes from the father.

        <h2>RNA</h2>

        <!-- dfn tag is used when a new term introduced -->
        <p>
          <dfn>Ribonucleic acid (RNA)</dfn> is a complex molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes.
        </p>

        <!-- abbr tag is used to mark abbreviations -->
        <p>
          <abbr title="Ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> is physically different from <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>: <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> contains two intercoiled strands, but <abbr title="Ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> only contains one single strand. <abbr title="Ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> also contains different bases from <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>. These bases are the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><dfn>A</dfn> Adenine</li>
          <li><dfn>G</dfn> Guanine</li>
          <li><dfn>C</dfn> Cytosine</li>
          <li><dfn>U</dfn> Uracil</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Adenine forms bonds with uracil, and guanine forms bonds with cytosine. In this way, we say that adenine is complementary to uracil and that guanine is complementary to cytosine. The first three bases are also found in <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, but uracil replaces thymine as a complement to adenine.

        <h2>Proteins</h2>
        <p>
          If <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> is just a storage of information, proteins do all the essential work. Proteins are extremely diverse in structure and function. Proteins take part in virtually every process in cells. Some proteins are enzymes that catalyze (help to happen) biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Many proteins have structural or mechanical functions, such as in muscle and in cells. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, and cell division. Most of our traits are determined by the quantity and quality of proteins that are synthesized in our cells.

        <p>
          Most of the genes are instructions on how to build a particular protein. Genes contain information about protein structure that determines its properties and functions Different proteins are encoded in different genes. Also, <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> contains information about conditions under which the protein is synthesized by the cell. Cells need different proteins in different situations.

        <h2>The central dogma</h2>
        <p>
          <dfn>The central dogma</dfn> of molecular biology is an explanation of the flow of genetic information within a biological system. It is often stated as “<abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> makes <abbr title="Ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr>, and <abbr title="Ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> makes protein”. The dogma is a framework for understanding the transfer of biological information between information-carrying biopolymers in living organisms. There are 3 major classes of such biopolymers: <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> and <abbr title="Ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> (both nucleic acids), and protein.
        </p>

          The general transfers describe the normal flow of biological information: <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> can be copied to <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> (<abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> replication), <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> information can be copied into <abbr title="Messenger Ribonucleic acid">mRNA</abbr> (transcription), and proteins can be synthesized using the information in <abbr title="Messenger Ribonucleic acid">mRNA</abbr> as a template (translation).
