Taking things from the web
You can use almost anything you like that you can find on the Web, but you should avoid
anything that is not open (e.g. that costs money or requires login or registration), or
anything from sites belonging to commercial companies. Being able to re-use other people's
ideas is an important web skill. However, it is essential that, on your report page, you
describe what you have taken, where you took it from, and what you have done to it. If you
copy-and-paste something almost without change, you must say that you have done it, it
must conform to the standards, and you shouldn't expect many marks for it, except for how
you have made it fit in with and enhance your own design. To get more marks you can use
code from elsewhere, document the source of the code in your report.html and then edit it
in some way. Showing you can adapt existing code will earn you more marks. In order to be
clear which material you have written and which you have used from elsewhere you will be
expected to provide comprehensive comments within your HTML, CSS and Javascript files
indicating code you have used, code you have adopted and edited and code that you have
written.
