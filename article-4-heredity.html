          <dfn>Heredity</dfn> (or inheritance) is the passing of traits (characteristics) from parents to offspring. This happens as a result of a process called <dfn>reproduction</dfn>. Reproduction could be asexual or sexual.
        </p>

        <p>
          <dfn>Asexual reproduction</dfn> is a type of reproduction that does not involve the fusion of special cells called gametes. The offspring that arise by asexual reproduction from either unicellular or multicellular organisms inherit the full set of genes of their single parent. Asexual reproduction is the primary form of reproduction for single-celled organisms such as archaea and bacteria. Many eukaryotic organisms including plants, animals, and fungi can also reproduce asexually.
        </p>

        <p>
          <dfn>Sexual reproduction</dfn> is a type of reproduction that involves a complex life cycle in which a special cells called gamete (such as a sperm or egg cell) with a single set of chromosomes (haploid) combines with another to produce a zygote that develops into an organism composed of cells with two sets of chromosomes (diploid).

        <h2>Cell division</h2>
        <p>
          <dfn>Cell division</dfn> is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. There are two distinct types of cell division:
        </p>

        <p>
          <dfn>Mitosis</dfn>: each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell. This type of cell division is involved in asexual reproduction and in ordinary lifecycle of organisms.

          </figure>
        </p>

        <p>
          <dfn>Meiosis</dfn>: the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half to produce gametes such as a sperm or egg cell. This type of cell division is involved in sexual reproduction.
