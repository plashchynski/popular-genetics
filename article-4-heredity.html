          <dfn>Heredity</dfn> (or inheritance) is the passing of traits (characteristics) from parents to offspring. Through heredity, variations between individuals can accumulate and cause species to evolve by <dfn>natural selection</dfn>. Heredity happens as a result of a process called <dfn>reproduction</dfn>. Reproduction could be asexual or sexual.
        </p>

        <p>
          <dfn>Asexual reproduction</dfn> is a type of reproduction that does not involve the fusion of special cells called gametes. The offspring that arise by asexual reproduction from either unicellular or multicellular organisms inherit the full set of genes of their single parent. Asexual reproduction is the primary form of reproduction for single-celled organisms such as archaea and bacteria. Many eukaryotic organisms including plants, animals, and fungi can also reproduce asexually.
        </p>

        <p>
          <dfn>Sexual reproduction</dfn> is a type of reproduction that involves a complex life cycle in which a special cells called gamete (such as a sperm or egg cell) with a single set of chromosomes (haploid) combines with another to produce a zygote that develops into an organism composed of cells with two sets of chromosomes (diploid).
        </p>

        <p>
          Organisms that reproduce through asexual reproduction tend to grow in number exponentially. However, because they rely on mutation for variations in their DNA, all members of the species have similar vulnerabilities. Organisms that reproduce sexually yield a smaller number of offspring, but the large amount of variation in their genes makes them less susceptible to disease.

        <h2>Cell division</h2>
        <p>
          <dfn>Cell division</dfn> is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. There are two distinct types of cell division:
        </p>

        <p>
          <dfn>Mitosis</dfn>: each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell. This type of cell division is involved in asexual reproduction and in ordinary lifecycle of organisms.

        </p>

        <p>
          <dfn>Meiosis</dfn>: the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half to produce gametes such as a sperm or egg cell. This type of cell division is involved in sexual reproduction.

        <h2>Genotype and phenotype</h2>
        <p>
          The <dfn>genotype</dfn> of an organism is its complete set of genetic material. However, the term is often used to refer to a single gene or set of genes, such as the genotype for eye color.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <dfn>phenotype</dfn> is the set of observable characteristics or traits of an organism. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The genotype is one of three factors that determine phenotype. The other two are the environmental and the epigenetic factors. The environmental factors are not inherited. Epigenetic factors are somewhat inherited. 'Non-genetic' inheritance (NGI) involves a wide range of epigenetic, cytoplasmic, and other mechanisms. The interaction between genotype and phenotype has often been conceptualized by the following relationship:

        <strong>genotype + environment â†’ phenotype</strong>

        <h2>Allele</h2>
        <p>
          A person has two copies of each gene, one from their mother, and one from their father.There can be several types of a single gene, which give different instructions: one version might cause a person to have blue eyes, another might cause them to have brown. These different versions are known as <dfn>alleles</dfn> of the gene.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since a living thing has two copies of each gene, it can have two different alleles of it at the same time. Often, one allele will be dominant, meaning that the living thing looks and acts as if it had only that one allele. The unexpressed allele is called recessive. In other cases, you end up with something in between the two possibilities. In that case, the two alleles are called co-dominant.
        </p>
