      <h2>Cells</h2>
      <p>
        All living things are made of millions of tiny self-contained components called cells. The <strong>cell</strong> is the basic structure of organisms. There are organisms made up of only one cell, like a bacteria or <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist">protist</a>. Such cell do everything that the organism needs to live: eat, get rid of waste, grow, reproduce. Some of them can even move and sense their environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are organisms made from many cells. This can be a small number of   cells, or millions or even trillions of cells. All plants and animals are multicellular organisms. The cells of a multicellular organism have different shapes and sizes, and do different work in the organism. By themselves, they cannot do everything that the organism needs to live. So they cooperate to do work together.

      <h2>DNA</h2>
      <p>
        Inside of each cell are long and complex molecules called DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Due to its special structure, this molecule is able to store information. Recently scientists learned how to read and decode this information. It turned out that most of characteristic of the living thing are encoded in DNA. Whether you have red hair or brown eyes, are tall or have freckles, these and many other unique traits are encoded in your DNA.

      <p>
        Structurally, DNA is a double helix shape, which is like a ladder twisted into a spiral. Each step of the ladder is a pair of nucleotides. Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA. There are four types of nucleotide in DNA:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Adenine (A)
          </li>
          <li>
            Thymine (T)
          </li>
          <li>
            Cytosine (C)
          </li>
          <li>
            Guanine (G)
          </li>
        </ul>

        For simplicity, it is most often used letter codes A, T, C, G in place of full nucleotide names.
      </p>

      <p>
        A, T, C, G is a only four-letter alphabet used to encode genetic information. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain called a DNA chain. The genetic information in DNA is encoded through the order, or sequence, of the nucleotides along each strand. Organisms differ from one another because their DNA molecules have different nucleotide sequences and, consequently, carry different biological messages.

      <h1>DNA sequencing</h1>
      <p>
        DNA sequencing is a laboratory technique used to determine the exact sequence of nucleotides in a DNA molecules. There are specifal laboratory instruments used to automate the DNA sequencing process, called DNA sequencers. Given a sample of some organic matter, you can load it into the DNA sequencer and after a while get a file consisting of A, C, G, T letters.

      <p>
        Knowledge of DNA sequences is important for genetical research, and in numerous applied fields such as medical diagnosis, biotechnology, and forensic.

        DNA contains a lot of different information, most of which seems meaningless or accidental.
