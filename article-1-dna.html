        <h2>Cells</h2>
        <p>
          All living things are made of millions of tiny self-contained components called cells. The <dfn>cell</dfn> is the basic structure of organisms. There are organisms made up of only one cell, like a bacteria or <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist">protist</a>. Such cell do everything that the organism needs to live: eat, get rid of waste, grow, reproduce. Some of them can even move and sense their environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are organisms made from many cells. This can be a small number of cells, or millions or even trillions of cells. All plants and animals are multicellular organisms. The cells of a multicellular organism have different shapes and sizes, and do different work in the organism. By themselves, they cannot do everything that the organism needs to live. So they cooperate to do work together.

        <h2>DNA</h2>
        <p>
          Inside of each cell are long and complex molecules called <dfn>DNA</dfn> (deoxyribonucleic acid). Due to its special structure, this molecule is able to store information. Recently scientists learned how to read and decode this information. It turned out that most of characteristic of the living thing are encoded in <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>. Whether you have red hair or brown eyes, are tall or have freckles, these and many other unique traits are encoded in your <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>.

        <p>
          Structurally, <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> is a double helix shape, which is like a ladder twisted into a spiral. Each step of the ladder is a pair of nucleotides. Nucleotides are the building blocks of <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>. There are four types of nucleotide in <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Adenine (A)
          </li>
          <li>
            Thymine (T)
          </li>
          <li>
            Cytosine (C)
          </li>
          <li>
            Guanine (G)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For simplicity, it is most often used letter codes A, T, C, G in place of full nucleotide names.

          <abbr title="Adenine">A</abbr>, <abbr title="Thymine">T</abbr>, <abbr title="Cytosine">C</abbr>, <abbr title="Guanine">G</abbr> is a only four-letter alphabet used to encode genetic information. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain called a <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> chain. The genetic information in <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> is encoded through the order, or sequence, of the nucleotides along each strand. Organisms differ from one another because their <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> molecules have different nucleotide sequences and, consequently, carry different biological messages.

        <h2>Chromosomes</h2>
        <p>
          Complex organisms contain a large amount of genetic information. It is rather difficult to store this amount of information in the form of one very large <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> molecule. To organize the storage of this information more efficiently and reliably, in complex organisms this information is divided into several pieces, chromosomes.
          A <dfn>chromosome</dfn> is a long <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> molecule with part or all of the genetic material of an organism. Each chromosome contains many genes. Chromosomes come in pairs: one set from the mother, the other set from the father.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are 46 chromosomes in a human, 23 pairs. Everyone has a set of chromosomes from their father and a matching set from their mother. They include a pair of sex chromosomes. The mother's eggs always contain an X chromosome, while the father's sperm contains either a Y chromosome or an X chromosome. That determines the sex of the child.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          Different animals have different numbers of chromosomes. If a person does not have the usual number of chromosomes, they may die or have one or more peculiarities. For example, they might get a genetic disorder like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome">Down syndrome</a> (extra chromosome 21) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinefelter_syndrome">Klinefelter syndrome</a> (a male with two X chromosomes).

        <h2>DNA sequencing</h2>
        <p>
          <dfn>DNA sequencing</dfn> is a laboratory technique used to determine the exact sequence of nucleotides in a <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> molecules. There are specifal laboratory instruments used to automate the <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> sequencing process, called <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> sequencers.

          Knowledge of <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> sequences is important for genetical research, and in numerous applied fields such as medical diagnosis, biotechnology, and forensic. The first <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> sequences were obtained in the early 1970s by academic researchers using laborious methods. Following the development of modern sequencing methods, <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> sequencing has become easier and orders of magnitude faster and cheaper.
