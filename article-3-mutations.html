        <h2>DNA replication</h2>
        <p>
          When DNA is copied, this is called <dfn>DNA replication</dfn>. Briefly, the hydrogen bonds holding together paired bases are broken and the molecule is split in half: the legs of the ladder are separated. This gives two single strands. New strands are formed by matching the bases (<abbr title="Adenine">A</abbr> with <abbr title="Thymine">T</abbr> and <abbr title="Guanine">G</abbr> with <abbr title="Cytosine">C</abbr>) to make the missing strands.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, an enzyme called <dfn>DNA helicase</dfn> splits the DNA down the middle by breaking the hydrogen bonds. Then after the DNA molecule is in two separate pieces, another molecule called <dfn>DNA polymerase</dfn> makes a new strand that matches each of the strands of the split DNA molecule. Each copy of a DNA molecule is made of half of the original (starting) molecule and half of new bases.

        <h2>Mutations</h2>
        <p>
          During the process of DNA replication, errors sometimes occur. These errors, called <dfn>mutations</dfn>. There are four main types of mutations:
          <ul>
            <li><dfn>Deletion</dfn>, where one or more bases are left out.</li>
            <li><dfn>Substitution</dfn>, where one or more bases are substituted for another base in the sequence.</li>
            <li><dfn>Insertion</dfn>, where one or more extra base is put in.</li>
            <li><dfn>Duplication</dfn>, where a sequence of bases pairs are repeated.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Error rates are usually very low—1 error in every 10–100 million bases—due to the "proofreading" ability of DNA polymerases. Mutations may be bad for the organism, or neutral, or of benefit. Sometimes mutations are fatal for the organism – the protein made by the new DNA does not work at all, and this causes the embryo to die. On the other hand, evolution is moved forward by mutations, when the new version of the protein works better for the organism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Processes that increase the rate of changes in DNA are called <dfn>mutagenic</dfn>. Mutagenic chemicals increase errors in DNA replication, often by interfering with the structure of base-pairing, while UV radiation induces mutations by causing damage to the DNA structure. Chemical damage to DNA occurs naturally as well, and cells use DNA repair mechanisms to repair mismatches and breaks in DNA—nevertheless, the repair sometimes fails to return the DNA to its original sequence.
