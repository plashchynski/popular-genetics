        <h2>DNA replication</h2>
        <!-- dfn tag is used when a new term introduced -->
        <p>
          When <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> is copied, this is called <dfn>DNA replication</dfn>. Briefly, the hydrogen bonds holding together paired bases are broken and the molecule is split in half: the legs of the ladder are separated. This gives two single strands. New strands are formed by matching the bases (<abbr title="Adenine">A</abbr> with <abbr title="Thymine">T</abbr> and <abbr title="Guanine">G</abbr> with <abbr title="Cytosine">C</abbr>) to make the missing strands.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, an enzyme called <dfn>DNA helicase</dfn> splits the <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> down the middle by breaking the hydrogen bonds. Then after the <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> molecule is in two separate pieces, another molecule called <dfn>DNA polymerase</dfn> makes a new strand that matches each of the strands of the split <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> molecule. Each copy of a <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> molecule is made of half of the original (starting) molecule and half of new bases.

        <h2>Mutations</h2>
        <p>
          During the process of <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> replication, errors sometimes occur. These errors, called <dfn>mutations</dfn>. There are four main types of mutations:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><dfn>Deletion</dfn>, where one or more bases are left out.</li>
          <li><dfn>Substitution</dfn>, where one or more bases are substituted for another base in the sequence.</li>
          <li><dfn>Insertion</dfn>, where one or more extra base is put in.</li>
          <li><dfn>Duplication</dfn>, where a sequence of bases pairs are repeated.</li>
        </ul>

        </figure>
        <p>
          Error rates are usually very low—1 error in every 10–100 million bases—due to the "proofreading" ability of <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> polymerases. Mutations may be bad for the organism, or neutral, or of benefit. Sometimes mutations are fatal for the organism – the protein made by the new <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> does not work at all, and this causes the embryo to die. On the other hand, evolution is moved forward by mutations, when the new version of the protein works better for the organism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Processes that increase the rate of changes in <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> are called <dfn>mutagenic</dfn>. Mutagenic chemicals increase errors in <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> replication, often by interfering with the structure of base-pairing, while UV radiation induces mutations by causing damage to the <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> structure. Chemical damage to <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> occurs naturally as well, and cells use <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> repair mechanisms to repair mismatches and breaks in DNA—nevertheless, the repair sometimes fails to return the <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> to its original sequence.

        <h2>Induced mutation</h2>

        <p>
          Induced mutations are alterations in the gene after it has come in contact with mutagens and environmental causes. Induced mutations on the molecular level can be caused by chemicals and radiation.

        <h2>Beneficial mutations</h2>

        <p>
          Although mutations that cause changes in protein sequences can be harmful to an organism, on occasions the effect may be positive in a given environment. In this case, the mutation may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild-type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation will tend to become more common in a population through natural selection. Examples include the following:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>HIV resistance</strong>: a specific 32 base pair deletion in human CCR5 (CCR5-Δ32) confers HIV resistance to homozygotes and delays AIDS onset in heterozygotes<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC56941/">source</a></sup>. One possible explanation of the etiology of the relatively high frequency of CCR5-Δ32 in the European population is that it conferred resistance to the bubonic plague in mid-14th century Europe. People with this mutation were more likely to survive infection; thus its frequency in the population increased.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Lactase persistence</strong>: A mutation allowed humans to express the enzyme lactase after they are naturally weaned from breast milk, allowing adults to digest lactose, which is likely one of the most beneficial mutations in recent human evolution<sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28426286/">source</a></sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Antibiotic resistance</strong>: Practically all bacteria develop antibiotic resistance when exposed to antibiotics. In fact, bacterial populations already have such mutations that get selected under antibiotic selection. Obviously, such mutations are only beneficial for the bacteria but not for those infected.
